# introDS_Titanic
## Intro to data science using the Titanic dataset 

### This project covers the following concepts: 
  1. Setting up data science environment locally.
    - Visual Studio
    - Keras and Tensorflow environment
  2. Preparing data: using pandas/numpy to clean the data.
  3. Using seaborn/matplotlib to view the data.
  4. Trainig ML Model, Evaluate accuracy when using Naive Bayes Algorithm for classification.
  5. Finally using a neural network to improve the accuracy of the model by about 6 percent- Sequential Neural         Network.
