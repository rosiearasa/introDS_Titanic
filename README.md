# introDS_Titanic
## Intro to data science using the Titanic dataset 

This project covers the following concepts: 
  Setting up data science environment locally
    -Visual Studio
    -Keras and Tensorflow environment
   Preparing data: using pandas/numpy to clean the data
   Using seaborn/matplotlib to view the data
   Trainig ML Model, Evaluate accuracy when using Naive Bayes Algorithm for classification
   Finally using a neural network to improve the accuracy of the model by about 6 percent- Sequential Neural Network
